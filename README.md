# C# Microservices Observability POC

## Overview

This repository contains a **proof-of-concept (POC)** microservices architecture implemented in C#/.NET 8, designed to demonstrate modern logging, metrics, alerting, and observability techniques using **Prometheus**, **Loki**, and **Grafana**.

The POC is intentionally small, yet realistic, and aims to showcase:

- Centralized **structured logging** with **correlation IDs** using **Serilog** piped to **Loki**.
- Service-level **Prometheus metrics** through `/metrics` endpoints.
- Real-time visualizations and **alerting** in **Grafana**.

This project is **also an experiment in AI context engineering**, using AI to plan, scaffold, and iteratively improve the architecture and codebase. All documentation and configuration are AI-assisted, with a focus on clear context and reproducibility.

---

## Architecture
- **User Service:** Handles user registration and info retrieval.
- **Order Service:** Manages orders, supports creating/fetching by user.
- **Payment Service:** Simulates processing payment for orders.
- **BFF (Backend For Frontend):** Provides a `/checkout` API orchestrating order creation and payment track events.
- **Frontend UI:** Simple interface for login, placing orders, and viewing paid/unpaid status.

All services use **.NET 8 Web APIs**.

**Note:** The `/checkout` and UI features have not been implemented because the simple backend services were enough to prove out the Loki / Grafana observability setup.

---

## Observability Stack
- **Logging:** Structured logs are sent to **Loki** (via Serilog), enriched with correlation IDs for cross-service traceability.
- **Metrics:** Each service exposes a `/metrics` endpoint for **Prometheus** to scrape.
- **Dashboards/Alerts:** **Grafana** provides dashboards and alert rules (for error rates, service unavailability, backlogs, etc).

All observability stack services are managed locally via **Docker Compose**.

## Running Locally

### Getting Started

 To verify the logs and metrics in Grafana:

   1. Access Grafana: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. The default credentials are
      admin/admin. You will be prompted to change the password on first login.

   2. Verify Data Sources:
       * Once logged in, go to "Configuration" (gear icon on the left sidebar) -> "Data Sources".
       * You should see "Prometheus" and "Loki" data sources listed and configured.

   3. Verify Logs (Loki):
       * Go to "Explore" (compass icon on the left sidebar).
       * Select the "Loki" data source.
       * On the right of the page there's a `Builder` and `Code` toggle, click `Code`.
       * Click on the query input and enter `{env="Development"}` to see logs from all services. You should see logs appearing from bff.api, order.service, payment.service, and user.service.

   4. Verify Metrics (Prometheus):
       * In "Explore", select the "Prometheus" data source.
       * Enter `http_requests_received_total` in the query field and run the query. You should see metrics data.

   5. Verify Custom Dashboard:
       * Go to "Dashboards" (dashboard icon on the left sidebar) -> "Browse".
       * You should find a dashboard named "BFF + Services API...". Click on it.
       * This dashboard should display both logs and the http_requests_received_total metric.

  To generate some logs and metrics, you can access the API endpoints:

   * Bff.Api: http://localhost:8080/swagger (and try the /Bff/user/{id} endpoint)
   * Order.Service: http://localhost:8081/swagger
   * Payment.Service: http://localhost:8082/swagger
   * User.Service: http://localhost:8083/swagger

  You can also directly access the Prometheus metrics endpoint for each service (e.g.,
  http://localhost:8080/metrics).

## Development Process

1. Scaffolded individual .NET 8 microservices for user, order, payment, and BFF API.


4. Implemented structured logging and metrics endpoints.
5. Deployed observability stack (Prometheus + Loki + Grafana) via Docker Compose.
6. Configured Grafana dashboards and basic alert rules.

## About AI Context Engineering
This project doubles as a testbed for leveraging AI in both project planning and hands-on implementation. Documentation, setup, and feature breakdowns are AI-curated to maximize clarity and context for developers and ops engineers.

### How did the AI Fare?

I used Gemini cli for most of the AI work and VSCode with the Continue plugin for code completion, using GPT 4o and 4.1.

In general it was very productive.

However it struggled to wire up Loki and Serilog properly; it really got stuck on setting up labels and it got the version numbers in the docker-compose well out of date.

I tried GPT 4.1 on the labels issue but in the end I had to review the [serilog-sinks-grafana-loki github repo](https://github.com/serilog-contrib/serilog-sinks-grafana-loki) to work out how the labels worked.
